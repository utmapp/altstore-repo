Note that currently, you must remove the Sound and Entropy device in order to use save/restore VM state.\r\n* **Automatically save state when you close a VM** This will only work on VMs that support save states. If your VM does not support it, you will get an error message with an explanation.\r\n* (macOS) **USB commands in utmctl** You can now use `utmctl usb` commands to connect and disconnect USB devices from a running VM.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore support for newer iOS** With the release of [TrollStore 2](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), this update brings JIT support for all iOS device that can run TrollStore. If (and only if) you are on at most iOS 16.3.1 AND your device is M1, M2, or A16, then you can also use the virtualization option. No other device or higher iOS version will likely ever be supported due to Apple [removing Hypervisor in iOS 16.4](http://twitter.com/utmapp/status/1708907045314035986). The only way around this is if Apple un-deletes the code (unlikely) or a jailbreak powerful enough to run a custom kernel is released (even more unlikely as this has never been done on a modern iOS device).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (macOS) If you are running a virtualized VM on an Intel Mac with TPM enabled and the guest freezes on startup, you will need to temporarily disable Hypervisor (Settings -> QEMU -> Use Hypervisor), boot into Windows, and then re-enable Hypervisor after shutting down. The TPM device changed in v4.4.1 and this causes an issue on existing VMs.\r\n* (macOS) When entering full-screen, auto-capture of system keys in AVF (introduced in v4.3.2) and of mouse in QEMU (introduced in v4.4.0) is no longer default. You can enable the option in preferences (Cmd+,) under the Input tab.\r\n* Linux guests: Mesa 23.2.1 introduced a bug that will crash UTM with the error `GL_ARB_clear_texture`. If you experience this bug, temporarily disable GPU acceleration, then downgrade your Mesa package (or update to the next version when it comes out/nightly build), and the switch back to GPU acceleration.\r\n* Windows guests: the guest tools have been updated to fix the double cursor bug as well as some driver signing issues when Secure Boot is enabled. To update the guest tools, make sure you have ejected any mounted ISO and then use the CD icon and select \"Install Windows Guest Tools\". This should automatically download and mount the latest tools.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.4.6)\r\n* Fixed a \"device not found\" error when starting a VM with an empty interface (#5845)\r\n* Fixed JIT for
